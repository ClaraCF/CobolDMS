An interactive command line utility to convert Decimal Degrees to Degrees, Minutes and Seconds (and viceversa).  
This is a rewrite of [this](https://github.com/qAxelFT/Degree2DegreeMinuteSecond-Conversor) project (originally written in Java) by [@qAxelFT](https://github.com/qAxelFT) written in COBOL.

## Why?
Because I'm a masochist.  
I got curious and decided it was a good idea to give COBOL a try.

## Requirements
To compile this project GnuCOBOL was used.  
On Linux distributions you can install it by running:
```bash
# Arch Linux
sudo pacman -S gnucobol

# Ubuntu and other Debian-based distros
sudo apt install gnucobol

# Gentoo
sudo emerge -v dev-lang/gnucobol
```

For other distros, as well as Windows and Mac users, you can download GnuCOBOL [here](https://gnucobol.sourceforge.io/).  
Other COBOL compilers may work too (perhaps).

## Compiling
First, you can get the repo by running:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/ClaraCF/CobolDMS
cd CobolDMS
```

To compile this project you may run the following command:
```bash
cobc -O2 -x main.cbl -o CobolDMS
```
Feel free to change the -O flag level to your liking, but I'd recommend not disabling it as it produces a warning otherwise.

## Usage
Upon running the generated executable, you'll be met with a menu with options. Use number to navigate through the different menus and submenus.  
![Main menu preview](https://github.com/ClaraCF/CobolDMS/blob/main/CobolDMS-Preview.png)  
There are currently three options in the main menu:
1. **Convertion from Decimal Degrees to Degrees, Minutes and Seconds**: Input a numeric value corresponding to decimal degrees to convert it to DMS.
2. **Convertion from Degrees, Minutes and Seconds to Decimal Degrees**: Input a numeric value corresponding to DMS to convert it to decimal degrees.
3. **Exit**: Exit üëç  

Selecting any of the conversion options will just prompt you to enter values and output a result.  
- Decimal Degrees to Degrees, Minutes and Second will ask you to enter a value corresponding to Decimal Degrees in the format of XXX.XXX and output the result in the format of XXX¬∫ XXX' XXX.XX".  
- Degrees, Minutes and Seconds to Decimal Degrees will ask you to enter three values:
  - Degrees in the format of an XXX integer (altough floating point is kinda supported)
  - Minutes in the format of an XX integer (altough up to 3 digits and floating points are kinda supported as well)
  - Seconds in the format of XX.XXX (altough up to 3 digits is kinda supported too)  
  
**NOTE**: Conversion from DMS to Degrees is a little imprecise. May try to fix eventually.  

Submenus currently have just 2 options:
1. Returning to the main menu to choose to perform another conversion
2. Exiting

Values that count as valid input are **positive** numbers with floating point with a limit of 3 digits before and after the point.  
For example: 10, 300, 123.50, 45.678, 0.  
Negative numbers and numbers with more than 3 digits before and/or after the floating point are not supported.  
Try not to break the program. It definitely will.  

## Contributing
Do you think you know COBOL better than I do? Well, you're absolutely right. If you think you have something to add, please feel free to contribute to this atrocious creation <3.  
Corrections and contributions to other things such as this README are also welcome and greatly appreciated. (Seriously c: <3).
